Forensics Checklist 

// strings  - to check for strings in a file. Including metadata
code: $ string filename 

//  binwalk - to extract any hidden file. 
code: $ binwalk -e filename
code: $ binwalk --dd='.*' filename

// Edit file header
code: $ hexeditor filename

// For Iso file,
    Extract with 7zip
    Mount in kali linux 
          code: $ mkdir newfolder/path
                $ sudo mount path/of/image.iso newfolder/path -o loop
                      
// Reverse engeering executables linux,
    IDA pro/free 
       Load file into IDA and Open Binary 
    gdb(peda)
        From terminal 
              code: $ gdb file 
        Running the program 
              code: $ run or $ r
        Check for all program sequence and list binary number  
              code: $ disas main
        Check for info register 
              code: $ info register or $i r
        Set program to be run one by one, "$ continue" will let the program to run normally.
              code: $ break main
        Scroll down program one by one
              code: $ next 
        Continue program
              code: $ continue (continue after set $rip to get the flag)
        Set next program to run, this process can skip any sequential program.
              code: $ set $rip binarynumber
              
  // set the correct binary number to skip any process to the selected process.
